            <p><strong>1. Title tags</strong><br> Assuming you&rsquo;ve already done your keyword research, this is one of the most important on-page SEO factors. If you haven&rsquo;t, here is a step-by-step guide on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/how-to-research-keywords-tips/">how to research  keywords</a>.<br>                The title tag tells search engines what the page is about and that the page on your website is relevant for that keyword or keyword phrase.&nbsp;<strong>Title tags should be  unique for every page.</strong>&nbsp;In search results, search
                engines will highlight your keyword phrases if a user has searched for those terms. This increases visibility and click-through rate.</p>
            <p><br>
                <strong>2. Meta descriptions</strong><br> Meta descriptions, while not as important in search engine rankings, are extremely important in getting users to click through from the search engine results page (SERP) to your website. Meta descriptions
                should use keywords wisely, but more importantly they should include a compelling description on which a user would want to click on.<br> Much like title tags, the SERPs will highlight keywords that the user searched for, increasing the
                likelihood of the user clicking through to your website.</p>
            <p><br>
                <strong>3. Content with  targeted keyword phrases</strong><br> Your content is the meat and potatoes of your website. With all of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda">Google Panda updates</a>, it is extremely important
                that your content is&nbsp;<strong>unique and relevant</strong>.&nbsp;If you have multiple pages with the same content (or if you have your content on other people&rsquo;s websites), you will run the risk of getting penalized by Google
                and your search rankings will suffer.<br> We want to keep Google happy, so keep your content unique.</p>
            <p><br>
                <strong>4. Header tags and  keyword phrases</strong><br> A header tag, also known as an H1 tag, is much like the subject line of your web page. You should only use your keyword phrase once in the H1 tag. This should be included on a page
                to which you are trying to drive unique traffic to. You can also use H2 tags (second header) if there are multiple sections.</p>
            <p><br>
                <strong>5. Internal page  linking with anchor text</strong><br> Internal linking refers to a link on a page that points to another page on the same website.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/internal-linking/" title="Internal Linking: 9 Best Practices for Internal Links">Internal linking</a>&nbsp;is
                important because it helps strengthen those keywords internally for those pages, it allows users (and search engine robots) to navigate through the website, and it tells the search engines that the page is relevant for that keyword phrase.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Image ALT tags and  filenames</strong><br> An alt tag is essentially the name of an image. All images should use appropriate alt tags. Not only are alt tags good for search engines; they are also good for accessibility. If someone
                is using a screen reader, they will be able to hear what that image is.<br> You should try to include your keyword phrase in the name of your image, if possible, but don&rsquo;t overdo it. Image filenames should also be SEO friendly. Image
                search is much more widely used than believed, so traffic from there is also valuable.</p>
            <p><br>
                <strong>7. Make content easy  to read</strong><br> This is not a huge factor in search engine rankings, but will help your users easily scan your content and find the keywords they are looking for. You should use bolding and bullet points
                to set apart words in the text, and this further tells the engines what is important on the page. Don&rsquo;t go wild or you&rsquo;ll end up cluttering up your page and aggravating the user.</p>
            <p><br>
                <strong>8. Meta keywords</strong><br> Meta keywords used to be popular back in the day. However, nowadays Google (or any other search engine for that matter) does not hold any weight to meta keywords, so go ahead and skip this.<br> If
                I missed anything, or if you have something to add, I&rsquo;d love to hear your comments below!</p>
